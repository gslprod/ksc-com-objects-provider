# COM objects provider (from KSC)

This application interacts with the Kaspersky Security Center server, receiving data from it and providing it to the [main application](https://github.com/gslprod/ksc-integration-unity). Named pipes are used to transfer data.

I had to create this module because Unity does not work well with COM objects.
